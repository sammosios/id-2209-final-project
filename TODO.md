# 3 places: 
- Library
- Bar
- Concert 

# 5 different types of guests:

- Party animal (bar + concert fan, is happy when it's loud and crowded)
- Chill introvert (library + bar fan, probably wants to just read a book, might socialize on occasion)
- Vegan (library + bar + concert fan, will initiate conversations about veganism. Only other vegans will gain happiness, all others will lose happiness from this conversation)
- Sociable (library + bar + concert fan, is happy in chill and crowded spaces)
- Cultured Trivia Lover (library + bar fan, loves to socialize but not when it's crowded)

# 3 personal traits that affect socialization rules
- Initiative (counts when making a decision, e.g. initiate conversation, switch places)
- Sociability (counts when deciding whether one will accept a social interaction)
- Happiness (unhappy guests should leave and go to another place)

# 1 interesting global value to monitor
- How frequently guests decide to leave a place


# idea: very loud and public exits
When a party animal with high initiative is at the bar, and the vibe is too quiet, they will publicly send a message to everyone in the bar saying "I'm going to the concert, this place SUCKS!". This way, other guests that are also unhappy and want to leave but have low initiative can follow.
